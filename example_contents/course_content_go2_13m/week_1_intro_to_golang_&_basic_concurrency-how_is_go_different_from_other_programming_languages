Page_name: How is Go different from other programming languages?

1. What are the methods to set the GOPATH in a Terminal?
   A) `setenv GOPATH`
   - Incorrect. In most terminals, `setenv` is not recognized as a command. However, you can set the environment variables differently in different operating systems and terminals such as using `export` in Unix/Linux or `set` in Windows.
   B) `go set GOPATH`
   - Incorrect. In Go environment setup, you don't set the GOPATH using Go's command-line interface. You'll need to use your system's environment variables setting methods.
   C) `export GOPATH=/your/path`
   - Correct. In a Unix/Linux operating system, you can set the GOPATH environment variable using `export`, followed by the path of your workspace.

2. Jun has created a Go workspace and divided it into three directories. Which directory should he place his Go source files?
   A) `pkg`
   - Incorrect. The `pkg` directory contains package objects. Jun should place his Go source files in the `src` directory.
   B) `src`
   - Correct. Yes, Jun should place his Go source files in the `src` directory.
   C) `bin`
   - Incorrect. The `bin` directory contains executable commands, not the source files.

3. If your project depends on various other packages, how could Go modules be of use?
   A) They can compile my Go source files faster.
   - Incorrect. Compiling Go source files faster isn't the primary purpose of Go modules. Go modules are essential for managing package dependencies in a project.
   B) They can create an organized workspace directory structure.
   - Incorrect. While an organized workspace is generally a good practice in large projects, Go modules aren't used explicitly for this purpose. Consider learning more about Go's workspace directory structure.
   C) They manage my package dependencies.
   - Correct. Yes, Go modules help manage package dependencies in your project.

4. To create a new Go module, what command would you run?
   A) `go mod create`
   - Incorrect. The command 'go mod create' doesn't exist in Go module commands. When starting a new module, a different command is used.
   B) `go mod new`
   - Incorrect. The command 'go mod new' doesn't exist in Go module commands. Creating a new module requires initializing it first with a different command.
   C) `go mod init`
   - Correct. Yes, you would use the 'go mod init' command to initialize and create a new module.

5. Where should you ideally create the Go module files in a repository for best practices?
   A) Inside a `modules` directory in my repository.
   - Incorrect. Placing Go Modules inside a specific `modules` directory is not the recommended best practice. When it comes to the placement of modules, consider the overall organization of your repository.
   B) In the `src` directory.
   - Incorrect. The 'src' directory usually holds source files. Go module files are typically kept at a different location in your repository. 
   C) At the root of my repository.
   - Correct. Yes, it is recommended to write Go module files at the root of your repository.
